This is a special readme for the CEFAS people and GOTM developers.
Actually, most of the bfm structure stems from gotm, particularly the 
makefile, so I have to thank again the GOTM team for the good work done.
The idea is that as long as there is no decision on how the gotm-bio interface 
will evolve, I will keep all the needed modifications within the bfm 
structure.
There are only 3 files that needs to be patched in gotm in order to use the 
bfm stuff (and also the other bio models).
I have now included a patch that can be applied to the development version of 
gotm as to last week.

The code on this branch is closely coupled to the main BFM trunk but will always 
have a special relation with gotm/getm. 

Installing CEFAS BFM_GOTM
1) Download the last gotm snapshot from the CVS
export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous:anonymous@bbh.homelinux.net:/public/cvs
export CVS_RSH=ssh
cvs checkout -d gotm-cefas gotm

2) Download the bfm from the svn repository
svn checkout http://www.bo.ingv.it/svn/bfm/branches/cefas/bfm-src 
$HOME/bfm-2.5e-cefas
(one line statement)
This statement downloads the latest revision for cefas in the directory 
$HOME/bfm2.5e-cefas (created by the command itself).
You can also browse the directory on-line by simply opening the URL above

3)  set the GOTMDIR and BFMDIR environment variables (can use the scripts 
bfm2.5e-cefas/bfm_env.(c)sh)

4) apply the bfm patch to BFM_GPTM and make the executable 
cd gotm-cefas
patch -p0 < $BFMDIR/src/gotm/patch_gotm_bfm_2.5e
cd src
make

5) download the running environment from the repository
svn checkout http://www.bo.ingv.it/svn/bfm/branches/cefas/bfm-run 
$HOME/bfm-run

cd to bfm-run/gotm/oysterground
make a link to the executable in $GOTMDIR/src  and (hopefully) run!
